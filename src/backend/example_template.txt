# Example Custom Template for Cross-Component Issue Detection

## Template Name: Connection Pool Exhaustion

### Rule Pattern:
[component_A] created [connection_count: number] connections to [resource_name] but only closed [closed_count: number] connections, causing [component_B] to fail with [error_type] error.

### Blank Definitions:
- [component_A]: The component that creates connections (e.g., Hive, Spark, Flink)
- [connection_count: number]: Number of connections created
- [resource_name]: The resource being connected to (e.g., database, HDFS, Kafka)
- [closed_count: number]: Number of connections properly closed
- [component_B]: The component affected by the connection leak
- [error_type]: The type of error encountered (e.g., timeout, connection refused)

### Example Filled Template:
Hive created 100 connections to HDFS but only closed 20 connections, causing Spark to fail with connection timeout error.

### How to Create Your Own Template:

1. Identify the pattern you want to detect
2. Use square brackets [] to mark blanks that need to be filled
3. Include type hints in blanks when helpful (e.g., [count: number])
4. Provide clear descriptions for each blank
5. Consider including an example of a filled template

### Tips:
- Make blanks specific but not too narrow
- Include both the cause and effect in your pattern
- Consider cross-component interactions
- Think about resource utilization patterns
