      "Based on the provided logs, let's attempt to fill in the template for a potential resource leak issue. The logs primarily involve Hive operations, and there is no explicit mention of resource application or release counts. However, we can make some educated guesses based on typical interactions between Hive and Hadoop.\n\n### Completed Template\n\nTemplate ID: resource_leak_resource_leak\nTemplate Content:\nResource leak rule:\n    [component_A]: Hive\n    [r]: unknown\n    [apply_count: number]: unknown\n    [operation_A]: CREATE TABLE operation\n    [component_B]: Hadoop\n    [release_count: number]: unknown\n    [operation_B]: unknown\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1. **[component_A]: Hive**\n   - **Evidence**: The logs are primarily from Hive operations, as indicated by the `QueryStart`, `TaskStart`, and `QueryEnd` entries.\n   - **Regular Expression**: `QueryStart QUERY_STRING=\"CREATE TABLE.*\"`\n   - **Reasoning**: The operations logged are Hive-specific, involving table creation and querying.\n\n2. **[r]: unknown**\n   - **Evidence**: The logs do not specify any resource type such as memory, connection, or thread.\n   - **Reasoning**: Without explicit log entries indicating resource types, this remains unknown.\n\n3. **[apply_count: number]: unknown**\n   - **Evidence**: There are no log entries indicating the number of resources applied.\n   - **Reasoning**: The logs focus on query execution without detailing resource allocation.\n\n4. **[operation_A]: CREATE TABLE operation**\n   - **Evidence**: The `QueryStart` log entry for the `CREATE TABLE` operation.\n   - **Regular Expression**: `QueryStart QUERY_STRING=\"CREATE TABLE.*\"`\n   - **Reasoning**: The operation involves creating a table, which is a resource-intensive operation in Hive.\n\n5. **[component_B]: Hadoop**\n   - **Evidence**: The use of Hadoop input and output formats (`org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.SymlinkTextInputFormat` and `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat`) indicates interaction with Hadoop.\n   - **Regular Expression**: `STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.*'`\n   - **Reasoning**: Hive relies on Hadoop for storage formats, indicating a cross-component interaction.\n\n6. **[release_count: number]: unknown**\n   - **Evidence**: There are no log entries indicating the number of resources released.\n   - **Reasoning**: The logs do not provide details on resource release.\n\n7. **[operation_B]: unknown**\n   - **Evidence**: The logs do not specify any operation by Hadoop that releases resources.\n   - **Reasoning**: Without explicit log entries, this remains unknown.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe logs do not provide sufficient detail to fully populate the template with specific resource leak information. The interaction between Hive and Hadoop is evident, but without explicit resource allocation and release details, many fields remain unknown. The template is filled with the best available information, and assumptions are made based on typical Hive and Hadoop interactions."
