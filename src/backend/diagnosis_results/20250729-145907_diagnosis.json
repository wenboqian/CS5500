      "To fill in the template, I will need to analyze the provided logs to identify any cross-component interactions that suggest a resource leak. Since I don't have the logs to analyze, I'll provide a general approach to how I would fill in the template based on typical log analysis.\n\n### Completed Template\n\n```\nResource leak rule:\n    [component_A]: Spark\n    [r]: memory\n    [apply_count: number]: 10\n    [operation_A]: job execution\n    [component_B]: Hadoop\n    [release_count: number]: 8\n    [operation_B]: data write\n```\n\n### Reasoning Section\n\n1. **[component_A]: Spark**\n   - **Evidence**: Typically, Spark is a component that requests resources like memory for job execution. If the logs show Spark initiating operations that require resources, it would be identified as component_A.\n   - **Regular Expression**: `Spark.*requesting.*memory`\n   - **Reasoning**: Spark is often involved in operations that require significant memory allocation, such as job execution.\n\n2. **[r]: memory**\n   - **Evidence**: Logs indicating memory allocation requests and releases.\n   - **Regular Expression**: `memory.*allocated|memory.*released`\n   - **Reasoning**: Memory is a common resource that can be leaked if not properly managed between components.\n\n3. **[apply_count: number]: 10**\n   - **Evidence**: Log lines showing the number of memory units requested by Spark.\n   - **Regular Expression**: `Spark.*allocated.*memory.*10`\n   - **Reasoning**: The logs should show a specific count of memory units requested by Spark.\n\n4. **[operation_A]: job execution**\n   - **Evidence**: Logs indicating the operation during which Spark requested memory.\n   - **Regular Expression**: `Spark.*job execution.*memory`\n   - **Reasoning**: Job execution is a common operation in Spark that requires memory allocation.\n\n5. **[component_B]: Hadoop**\n   - **Evidence**: Logs showing Hadoop releasing resources.\n   - **Regular Expression**: `Hadoop.*releasing.*memory`\n   - **Reasoning**: Hadoop often interacts with Spark, especially in data processing and storage operations.\n\n6. **[release_count: number]: 8**\n   - **Evidence**: Log lines showing the number of memory units released by Hadoop.\n   - **Regular Expression**: `Hadoop.*released.*memory.*8`\n   - **Reasoning**: The logs should indicate a specific count of memory units released by Hadoop, which is less than what was requested by Spark.\n\n7. **[operation_B]: data write**\n   - **Evidence**: Logs indicating the operation during which Hadoop released memory.\n   - **Regular Expression**: `Hadoop.*data write.*memory`\n   - **Reasoning**: Data write operations in Hadoop often involve releasing resources like memory.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- The logs contain clear indications of resource requests and releases, with specific counts.\n- Spark and Hadoop are interacting components in the scenario.\n- Memory is the resource in question, as it is a common resource that can be leaked.\n\nIf the logs were available, I would use the regular expressions to extract specific lines and verify the assumptions made. If any of the assumptions do not hold, the template would need to be adjusted accordingly."
