      "Based on the provided Hive log, let's attempt to fill in the template for a potential resource leak issue. However, the log does not explicitly indicate a resource leak, but we can make some assumptions based on typical interactions between Hive and Hadoop.\n\n### Completed Template\n\n```\nResource leak rule:\n    [component_A]: Hive\n    [r]: unknown\n    [apply_count: number]: unknown\n    [operation_A]: CREATE TABLE operation\n    [component_B]: Hadoop\n    [release_count: number]: unknown\n    [operation_B]: unknown\n```\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1. **[component_A]: Hive**\n   - **Evidence**: The log is from a Hive job log, indicating that Hive is the component initiating operations.\n   - **Log Lines**: All lines in the log are related to Hive operations.\n   - **Regular Expression**: `SessionStart SESSION_ID=\".*\"`\n\n2. **[r]: unknown**\n   - **Reasoning**: The log does not specify any particular resource type (e.g., memory, connection, thread) being applied or released. It primarily details query execution.\n   - **Assumptions**: Without explicit mention of resources, we cannot determine the resource type.\n\n3. **[apply_count: number]: unknown**\n   - **Reasoning**: The log does not provide information on the number of resources applied. It focuses on query execution and task completion.\n   - **Assumptions**: Resource application details are not present in the log.\n\n4. **[operation_A]: CREATE TABLE operation**\n   - **Evidence**: The log includes a `CREATE TABLE` query, which is an operation where resources might be applied.\n   - **Log Lines**: \n     - `QueryStart QUERY_STRING=\"CREATE TABLE user_logs...\"`\n   - **Regular Expression**: `QueryStart QUERY_STRING=\"CREATE TABLE.*\"`\n\n5. **[component_B]: Hadoop**\n   - **Evidence**: The log mentions Hadoop input and output formats, indicating Hadoop's involvement.\n   - **Log Lines**: \n     - `STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.SymlinkTextInputFormat'`\n     - `OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'`\n   - **Regular Expression**: `STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.*'`\n\n6. **[release_count: number]: unknown**\n   - **Reasoning**: The log does not specify the number of resources released. It only shows task and query completion.\n   - **Assumptions**: Resource release details are not present in the log.\n\n7. **[operation_B]: unknown**\n   - **Reasoning**: The log does not detail any specific operation by Hadoop that releases resources. It focuses on Hive's operations.\n   - **Assumptions**: Without explicit mention, we cannot determine the operation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe log primarily details Hive's interaction with Hadoop through input and output formats, but it does not provide explicit evidence of a resource leak. The template is filled with 'unknown' for resource-specific details due to the lack of explicit information in the log. If more detailed logs or additional context were available, a more precise analysis could be conducted."

It focuses on task and query completion.\n   - **Assumptions**: Consequence details are not present in the log.\n\n5. **[affected_operations]: unknown**\n   - **Reasoning**: The log does not detail any specific operations affected by resource contention. It focuses on Hive's operations.\n   - **Assumptions**: Without explicit mention, we cannot determine the affected operations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe log primarily details Hive's interaction with Hadoop through input and output formats, but it does not provide explicit evidence of resource contention.
