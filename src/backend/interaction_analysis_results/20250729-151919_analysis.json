  "interaction_pairs": "To construct a cross-component interaction relationship graph from the provided Hive log, we need to identify interactions between different frameworks based on the criteria given. The log primarily involves Hive and Hadoop components. Here's how we can construct the graph:\n\n### Analysis and Assumptions\n\n1. **Components Identified:**\n   - **Hive:** The primary component executing the SQL queries.\n   - **Hadoop:** Utilized for data storage and retrieval through input and output formats.\n\n2. **Interaction Identification:**\n   - **Hive and Hadoop Interaction:**\n     - The `CREATE TABLE` operation in Hive uses Hadoop's input and output formats (`SymlinkTextInputFormat` and `HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat`), indicating a direct interaction with Hadoop for data storage.\n\n3. **Assumptions:**\n   - The log does not mention other frameworks like Spark or Flink, so we assume no interactions with these components.\n   - The interaction is based on the use of Hadoop's storage formats, which is a common integration point for Hive.\n\n### JSON Representation of Interaction\n\nBased on the analysis, the interaction relationship graph can be represented in JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Hive\": \"Hadoop\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Regular Expressions for Log Extraction\n\nTo help developers extract the corresponding log lines, we can provide regular expressions:\n\n- **Hive to Hadoop Interaction:**\n  - **Regular Expression:** `CREATE TABLE.*STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org\\.apache\\.hadoop\\.hive\\.ql\\.io\\.SymlinkTextInputFormat'.*OUTPUTFORMAT 'org\\.apache\\.hadoop\\.hive\\.ql\\.io\\.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'`\n  - **Description:** This regex captures the `CREATE TABLE` statement in Hive that specifies the use of Hadoop's input and output formats, indicating the interaction.\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n- We identified the components involved in the log and analyzed the operations performed.\n- We determined the interaction based on the use of Hadoop's storage formats by Hive.\n- We constructed the JSON representation to reflect the identified interaction.\n- We provided a regular expression to extract relevant log lines that demonstrate this interaction.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the interaction between Hive and Hadoop is clearly documented and can be easily extracted from the logs for further analysis or debugging.",
  "dispatched_interactions": "To classify the interaction between Hive and Hadoop from the provided logs into one of the specified interaction patterns, we need to analyze the nature of their interaction and determine the appropriate pattern. Here's the structured JSON output along with the reasoning, assumptions, and regular expressions:\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"resource_invocation\": [\n    {\n      \"components\": [\"Hive\", \"Hadoop\"],\n      \"resource\": \"Hadoop Input/Output Formats\",\n      \"regex\": \"CREATE TABLE.*STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org\\\\.apache\\\\.hadoop\\\\.hive\\\\.ql\\\\.io\\\\.SymlinkTextInputFormat'.*OUTPUTFORMAT 'org\\\\.apache\\\\.hadoop\\\\.hive\\\\.ql\\\\.io\\\\.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Components and Resource Identification:**\n   - **Hive** is executing SQL queries and creating tables.\n   - **Hadoop** is utilized for data storage and retrieval through specific input and output formats.\n\n2. **Interaction Pattern Determination:**\n   - The interaction between Hive and Hadoop is classified as `resource_invocation` because:\n     - Hive invokes Hadoop's input and output formats (`SymlinkTextInputFormat` and `HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat`) to store and retrieve data.\n     - This invocation is a direct use of Hadoop's resources by Hive, fitting the `resource_invocation` pattern.\n\n3. **Regular Expression:**\n   - The provided regex captures the `CREATE TABLE` statement in Hive that specifies the use of Hadoop's input and output formats, indicating the interaction.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- The log does not mention other frameworks like Spark or Flink, so we assume no interactions with these components.\n- The interaction is based solely on the use of Hadoop's storage formats by Hive, which is a common integration point.\n- We assume that the use of specific input and output formats in the `CREATE TABLE` statement is sufficient to establish a `resource_invocation` interaction pattern.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the interaction between Hive and Hadoop is clearly documented, classified, and can be easily extracted from the logs for further analysis or debugging.",
