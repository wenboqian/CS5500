  "interaction_pairs": "To construct a cross-component interaction relationship graph from the provided logs, we need to identify interactions based on shared resource utilization or invocation patterns. Given the logs, we primarily have Hive operations with references to Hadoop I/O formats. Here's how we can construct the graph:\n\n### Analysis and Assumptions\n\n1. **Components Identified:**\n   - **Hive**: The primary component executing queries.\n   - **Hadoop**: Referenced through I/O formats used in Hive queries.\n\n2. **Interaction Identification:**\n   - **Hive and Hadoop**: Interaction is identified through the use of Hadoop's I/O formats (`org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.SymlinkTextInputFormat` and `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat`) in Hive queries. This indicates that Hive relies on Hadoop's infrastructure for data storage and retrieval.\n\n3. **Assumptions:**\n   - The logs provided do not explicitly mention other components like Spark or Flink. Therefore, interactions are only identified between Hive and Hadoop.\n   - The interaction is based on the shared use of Hadoop's I/O formats, which is a common pattern in Hive operations.\n\n### JSON Representation\n\nThe JSON file describing the interaction relationships is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Hive\": \"Hadoop\",\n    \"interaction_reason\": \"Hive uses Hadoop's I/O formats for data storage and retrieval.\",\n    \"log_extraction_regex\": [\n      \"CREATE TABLE .* STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org\\\\.apache\\\\.hadoop\\\\.hive\\\\.ql\\\\.io\\\\.SymlinkTextInputFormat'\",\n      \"CREATE TABLE .* OUTPUTFORMAT 'org\\\\.apache\\\\.hadoop\\\\.hive\\\\.ql\\\\.io\\\\.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n- **Hive to Hadoop Interaction**: The interaction is established through the use of specific Hadoop I/O formats in Hive's `CREATE TABLE` statements. This is a direct interaction where Hive relies on Hadoop's capabilities to manage data input and output.\n\n- **Regular Expressions**: The provided regular expressions are designed to extract log lines where Hive specifies the use of Hadoop's I/O formats. These expressions match the `CREATE TABLE` statements that include the specific input and output formats.\n\nThis JSON structure provides a clear representation of the interaction between Hive and Hadoop based on the logs. It includes the reasoning for the interaction and the regular expressions to extract relevant log lines, aiding developers in identifying and understanding these interactions.",
  "dispatched_interactions": "Based on the provided logs and the identified interaction between Hive and Hadoop, we can classify the interaction pattern and provide a structured JSON object as requested.\n\n### Analysis and Classification\n\n1. **Components Identified:**\n   - **Hive**: Executes queries and manages data operations.\n   - **Hadoop**: Provides I/O formats used by Hive for data storage and retrieval.\n\n2. **Interaction Identification:**\n   - The interaction between Hive and Hadoop is based on the use of Hadoop's I/O formats in Hive's `CREATE TABLE` statements.\n\n3. **Interaction Pattern Classification:**\n   - **Interaction Pattern**: `shared_object`\n     - **Reasoning**: Both Hive and Hadoop use the same I/O formats, which are abstract resources. Hive specifies these formats in its queries, indicating a shared use of these resources.\n     - **Resource**: Hadoop I/O formats (`org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.SymlinkTextInputFormat` and `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat`).\n\n4. **Regular Expressions:**\n   - To extract relevant log lines, the following regex patterns can be used:\n     - `\"CREATE TABLE .* STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org\\\\.apache\\\\.hadoop\\\\.hive\\\\.ql\\\\.io\\\\.SymlinkTextInputFormat'\"`\n     - `\"CREATE TABLE .* OUTPUTFORMAT 'org\\\\.apache\\\\.hadoop\\\\.hive\\\\.ql\\\\.io\\\\.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'\"`\n\n5. **Assumptions:**\n   - The logs do not mention other components like Spark or Flink, so the interaction is limited to Hive and Hadoop.\n   - The interaction is classified as `shared_object` because both components utilize the same I/O formats, which are considered shared resources.\n\n### JSON Representation\n\n```json\n{\n  \"shared_object\": [\n    (\"Hive\", \"Hadoop\", \"Hadoop I/O formats\"),\n    {\n      \"log_extraction_regex\": [\n        \"CREATE TABLE .* STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org\\\\.apache\\\\.hadoop\\\\.hive\\\\.ql\\\\.io\\\\.SymlinkTextInputFormat'\",\n        \"CREATE TABLE .* OUTPUTFORMAT 'org\\\\.apache\\\\.hadoop\\\\.hive\\\\.ql\\\\.io\\\\.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'\"\n      ],\n      \"reasoning\": \"Hive and Hadoop both use the same I/O formats, indicating a shared use of these resources.\",\n      \"assumptions\": \"The interaction is limited to Hive and Hadoop based on the provided logs, focusing on shared I/O formats.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object captures the interaction pattern between Hive and Hadoop, classifying it as a `shared_object` due to the shared use of Hadoop's I/O formats. The regular expressions provided can be used to extract relevant log lines, and the reasoning and assumptions are clearly stated to support the classification.",
